Okay need two things for sure:

    * Fix Sort_GPT_Scripts/extractor.py so that it doesn't use internet
        - It basically just collects all the conversation titles from the
            openai's html formatted data file (one variable is like 100mb)
        - Right now it's using a google page to open the html file and 
            scans and stores all those titles from the page
        - Instead should just do it a local way without the google page

    * Fix Terminal/commands/search_titles.py so that it scans all the titles
        from coordinate_data/conversation_index.json
        - Right now it's messy. It should have a solid search engine
        - Relating titles when searching specific terms scanning all titles
        - ie: typing 'Quantum' brings up: 
            [0] binary-vs-[quantum]-thinking       ▐  -mystery-discussion       
            [1] formatting-[quantum]-curvature        -scale-explained          
            [2] geometric-[quantum]-wavefunction-r…   -teleportation-over-fiber 
            [3] h-bar-in-[quantum]-mechanics
        - It should also show related titles (like maybe dark matter or 
            physics topics) As if they have weights.
